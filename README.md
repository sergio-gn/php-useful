## useful built-in functions for testing<br/>

### Debugging variable:
> var_dump('test');
> When you call var_dump() with a variable as its argument, it outputs detailed information about the variable's data type, value, and structure.

> print_r($test);
> print_r() is a built-in function in PHP used for printing human-readable information about a variable. It's particularly helpful for debugging and inspecting the contents of arrays and objects.

> flush();
> The flush() function is used to force the PHP script to send any output that's currently in the buffer to the browser. This can be useful in situations where you want to ensure that data is sent to the browser immediately, rather than waiting for the entire script to finish executing.
